  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Transform your business with Microsoft Power Platform, Dynamics 365, and Power BI faster. At NIOS, we turn slow, spreadsheet-bound processes into secure, scalable apps, automated workflows, and crystal-clear reporting that work seamlessly across Microsoft 365 and Azure.</p>
  <p>We start with a low-code first approach for speed and value, building solutions in Power Apps, Power Automate, Dynamics 365, and Power BI, then add custom development where complexity demands it. From gathering requirements to delivering the finished product, we handle it all: configuration, integration with third-party systems and Azure services, and bespoke enhancements through custom development.</p>
  <p>We also build your teamâ€™s capability with tailored training in Power Platform, Power BI, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams so improvements last.</p>
