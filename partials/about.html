        <h2>Delivering outcomes with Microsoft Power Platform craftsmanship</h2>
        <p class="section__lede">NIOS helps organisations move from fragmented, spreadsheet-bound processes to governed, scalable digital products that run seamlessly across Microsoft Power Platform, Dynamics 365 and Azure.</p>
      </header>
      <p>We lead engagements from discovery through adoption, capturing requirements with stakeholders, translating them into robust solution architectures and delivering production-ready apps, automations and insights.</p>
      <p>Our low-code first approach accelerates delivery while maintaining enterprise-grade quality. Where complexity demands it, we layer in custom development, Azure integrations and DevOps pipelines without compromising maintainability.</p>
      <p>To make improvements stick, we embed training, handover and enablement for your teams â€” building confidence to evolve solutions long after launch.</p>
